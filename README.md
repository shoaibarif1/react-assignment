# Shift Booking Application

This project is a Shift Booking Application built with React. It allows users to view, book, and cancel shifts. The project uses mock data to simulate the API for managing shifts.

## Features

## My Shifts:

* View all booked shifts, grouped by dates.
  
* Shifts can be canceled.

## Available Shifts:
* View available shifts
* filtered by city (Helsinki, Tampere, Turku).
* Shifts can be booked or canceled.
* Prevents booking overlapping shifts.



### My Shifts
Shows all the booked shifts, grouped by today's, tomorrow's, and future shifts. Users can cancel shifts unless theyâ€™ve already started or completed.

### Available Shifts
Displays shifts filtered by city. Users can book or cancel shifts, and overlapping bookings are prevented.

### How the App Works

* State Management: The app uses React's Context API to manage global state.
* Mock API: Instead of calling a backend API, the app loads data from a mock file mockShifts.js.
* Booking Shifts: When a shift is booked, it is added to the bookedShifts array and marked as booked in availableShifts.
* Canceling Shifts: Shifts can be canceled if they have not started. Once canceled, the shift is removed from bookedShifts.
